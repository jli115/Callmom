Call Mom is an Arduino-based networking project that uses a light sensor to determine when mom’s reading lamp is switched on and sends you a notification that she’s in relaxation mode, ready to hear from you. The device is small enough to fit inside a decorative object such as a book or a box allowing it to blend seamlessly with her bedroom decor. Powered by a simple battery pack it’s a low maintenance internet connected device that sits by her bedside. This new iteration includes a smartphone-friendly interface that allows the user to call or message mom directly as well as monitor her sleeping patterns and phone call statistics. In the gallery setting this project is presented as a set of bedside vignettes that are built using found-objects which allow the viewer to imagine the world of three unique moms as they wind down for the night.
